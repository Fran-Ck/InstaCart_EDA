# InstaCart_EDA
This notebook is a simple exploration of the consumers buying habits in an online store-"insta-Cart". 
By understanding the purchasing behavior of the clients through the orders, the online retailer is able to predict which products are likely to go into the cart next.
This information will help the retailer in making decisions on to the availability of certain products when they are needed and also finding a way to promote products that are slow moving.

The First Graph shows that Saturday and Sundays are the days when orders are high, similarly orders are very low on wednesdays.

Graph two shows the frequency of order by hour of the day, in which majority of orders are made during the day.

Graph three visualizes the frequency of day weeks vs hours of day, where saturday evenings and sunday mornings are prime for orders.

Finally Graph 4, shows the frequency distribution by days since prior order. Most customers order once in every week and also 
once in every month.
